    "text": "Abstract. This is a reserarch proposal, the project is about measuring fiscal policy effects using Bayesian Structural Vector Autoregression(SVAR) in Australian Economy. Inpulse responses of stock prices and macroeconomic aggregated are expected to be investigated.\nKeywords. fiscal policy shock, SVAR, tax shocks, stock price, impulse response function\n\n\nMotivation\nThis research project will investigate the effects on fiscal policy. How does tax cuts affect the economy? Will tax reductions boost stock market? These questions are crucial to understanding of dynamic economics and the stimulus policy-making process, and are aimed to be answered in the background of Australian Economy.\nEffects of tax shocks on output has been investigated heavily in the previous literature. For example, Mountford and Uhlig (2009) found an unanticipated deficit-financed tax cut could stimulate the economy in terms of fiscal policy, using sign restrictions. They also revealed that investment falls when tax increases and government spending increases.\nWhile fiscal policy shocks have evidence of playing a role in affecting output, the effects on stock prices is ambiguous. Afonso and Sousa (2011) illustrated government spending shocks have negative effect on stock prices, whereas expansionary tax shocks are related to increase of stock prices. However, Charziantoniou et al. (2013) argued there was no monetary policy indicators in Afonso and Sousa (2011), these authors also suggested over 1991 to 2010, on real and financial variables were not affected by government spending shocks significantly.\nAlthough there is an unignorable amount of literature regarding the effects of fiscal policy, among which a large proportion of data analysed is based on US market. This paper aims to fill the lack of such literature in Australian economy.\n\n\nData\nThe variables that are of interest include GDP, total government expenditure, total government revenue, cash rate target, inflation, public debt and stock prices. Those economic variables were collected from Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) and Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), spanning quarterly from 1990 Q1 to 2022 Q4.\nStock prices are data of All Ordinaries, which is the benchmark of Australian market with relative long history, separate financial sectors might be studies into detail in the future research. All Ordinaries data started from 2001-04-19, however matching the date need to truncate 10 years of observations, which might result in a small sample size, thus, sub-samples would be considered to be implemented, for example, there might be one sample containing all the variables from 1990 to 2022 except stock prices to investigate the effects on economy. Inflation and cash rate target are introduced in the model as controls.\nVariables are transformed into log real per-capita terms except inflation and cash rate target to save computing power. In this stage, only the sample including all variables ranging from 2001 Q2 to 2022 Q4 is considered in the methodology section later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1 provides summary statistics of wrangled data.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Summary Statistics\n\n\n\nN\nMean\nSt.Dev.\nMin\nMax\n\n\n\n\nGDP\n132\n5.131\n0.164\n4.813\n5.356\n\n\nSpending\n132\n3.472\n0.197\n3.119\n3.846\n\n\nRevenue\n132\n5.024\n0.173\n4.654\n5.301\n\n\nDebt\n132\n4.660\n0.664\n3.549\n5.900\n\n\nInflation\n132\n0.650\n0.617\n-1.923\n3.704\n\n\nInterest\n132\n4.605\n2.906\n0.100\n16.750\n\n\nStock\n87\n6.234\n0.298\n5.605\n6.875\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlots of transformed data are shown as: Figure 1.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Time Series Plots\n\n\n\n\nWhile logarithms of real per capita GDP and government expenditure depict upward trend, government revenue shows seasonal patterns. Public debt has a significant drop starting end of 1990s. Interest rate has a downward trend while stock prices exhibiting downward trend after the Global Financial Crisis (GFC).\n\n\nMethodology\nBayesian Structural vector autoregression (SVAR) models can be used to estimate the impact of taxation shocks in Australian economy. The benchmark model is defined as:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nB_0Y_t = b_0 + \\sum_{i=1}^{p}B_{i}Y_{t-i}+u_t\n\\end{align}\\] \\[\\begin{align}\nu_t|Y_{t-1}\\sim iid(0_N,I_N)\n\\end{align}\\]\n\\(Y_t\\) is \\(N\\times1\\) matrix of endogenous variables,N represents the number of endogeneous variables and p is the number of lags. \\(B_0\\) is \\(N\\times N\\) matrix capturing contemporaneous relationships between variables, and \\(u_t\\) is \\(N\\times1\\) vector conditionally on \\(Y_{t-1}\\) orthogonal structural shocks.\nIn particular, in this model, \\(Y_t\\) contains seven variables ordered as : (1) real per-capita GDP (\\(G_t\\)), (2) real per-capita government expenditure (\\(E_t\\)), (3) real per-capita government revenue (\\(R_t\\)), (4) real per-capita public debt (\\(D_t\\)), (5) inflation (\\(i_t\\)), (6) cash rate target (r_t), (7) real stock price (\\(S_t\\)).\nThe reduced form representation is: \\[\\begin{align}\nY_t = \\mu_0 + \\sum_{i=1}^{p}A_{i}Y_{t-i}+\\epsilon_t\n\\end{align}\\] \\[\\begin{align}\n\\epsilon_t|Y_{t-1}\\sim iid(0_N,\\Sigma)\n\\end{align}\\]\nThe covariance matrix of \\(\\epsilon_t\\) can be written as: \\[\\begin{align}\n\\Sigma=B_0^{-1}{B_0^{-1}}^{'}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nPreliminary Results\nACF Plots as in Figure 2 shown significant non-zero autocorrelation for at least 15 lags of variables except Inflation. PACF Plots as Figure 3 indicate significant and strong memory at the first lag of variables except Inflation, of which the first lag is also statistically significant.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: ACF Plots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Partial ACF Plots\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\nMountford and Uhlig (2009)\nAfonso and Sousa (2011)\nCharziantoniou et al. (2013)"
