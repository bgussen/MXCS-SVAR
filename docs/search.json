    "text": "Abstract. This is a reserarch proposal, the project is about measuring fiscal policy effects using Bayesian Structural Vector Autoregression (SVAR) in Australian Economy. Inpulse responses of stock prices and macroeconomic aggregates will be investigated.\nKeywords. fiscal policy shock, SVAR, tax shocks, stock price, impulse response function\n\n\nMotivation\nThis research project will investigate the effects on fiscal policy. How does tax cuts affect the economy? Will tax reductions boost stock market? These questions are crucial to the understanding of dynamic economics and the stimulus policy-making process, and are aimed to be answered in the background of Australian Economy in this project.\nEffects of tax shocks on output has been investigated heavily in the previous literature. For example, Mountford and Uhlig (2009) found an unanticipated deficit-financed tax cut could stimulate the economy as a fiscal policy, using sign restrictions. They also revealed that investment falls when tax increases and government spending increases as investigated by Blanchard and Perotti (2002). Romer and Romer (2007) suggested exogeneous tax changes could end with large difference.\nWhile fiscal policy shocks have evidence of playing a role in affecting output, the effects on stock prices is ambiguous. Afonso and Sousa (2011) illustrated government spending shocks have negative effect on stock prices, whereas expansionary tax shocks are related to increase of stock prices. However, Charziantoniou et al. (2013) argued there was no monetary policy indicators in Afonso and Sousa (2011), these authors suggested over 1991 to 2010, real and financial variables were not affected by government spending shocks significantly.\nAlthough there is an unignorable amount of literature regarding the effects of fiscal policy, among which a large proportion of data analysed is based on US economy. This paper aims to fill the lack of such literature about Australian economy.\n\n\nData\n\n\n\nThe variables that are of interest include GDP, total government expenditure, total government revenue, cash rate target, inflation, public debt and stock prices. Those economic variables were collected from Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) and Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), spanning quarterly from 1990 Q1 to 2022 Q4.\nStock prices are data of All Ordinaries, which is the benchmark of Australian market with relative long history, separate financial sectors might be studied into detail in the future research. All Ordinaries data started from 2001-04-19, matching the date need to truncate 10 years of observations, which will result in a smaller sample size, thus, sub-samples would be considered to be implemented, for example, there could be one sample containing all the variables from 1990 to 2022 except stock prices to investigate the effects on economy. Inflation and cash rate target are also introduced in the model as controls.(Plots of original data are shown in Figure 1.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Time Series Plots : in nominal prices\n\n\n\n\nWhile GDP and government expenditure depict upward trend, government revenue shows increasing trend with seasonal patterns. Public debt kept relatively flat before the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), and started to increase after. Interest rate has a downward trend while stock prices exhibiting significant drop during GFC.\nVariables are transformed into real per-capita terms and compute logarithms as in Mumtaz and Theodoridis (2020), except inflation and cash rate target. In this stage, only the sample including all variables ranging from 2001 Q2 to 2022 Q4 is considered in the following section. Plots are provided as Figure 2.\n\n\n\nTable 1 provides summary statistics of wrangled datan from 2001Q2 to 2022Q4.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Summary Statistics\n\n\n\nN\nMean\nSt.Dev.\nMin\nMax\n\n\n\n\nGDP\n87\n5.235\n0.072\n5.071\n5.356\n\n\nSpending\n87\n3.587\n0.130\n3.381\n3.846\n\n\nRevenue\n87\n5.131\n0.088\n4.925\n5.301\n\n\nDebt\n87\n4.724\n0.794\n3.549\n5.900\n\n\nInflation\n87\n0.653\n0.547\n-1.923\n2.098\n\n\nInterest\n87\n3.372\n2.006\n0.100\n7.250\n\n\nStock\n87\n4.102\n0.151\n3.784\n4.484\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Time Series Plots (Green lines are log transformation)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethodology\nBayesian Structural vector autoregression (SVAR) models to capture the dynamic and contemporaneous relationships between variables. The benchmark model is defined as:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nB_0Y_t = b_0 + \\sum_{i=1}^{p}B_{i}Y_{t-i}+u_t\n\\end{align}\\] \\[\\begin{align}\nu_t|Y_{t-1}\\sim iid(0_N,I_N)\n\\end{align}\\]\n\\(Y_t\\) is \\(N\\times1\\) matrix of endogenous variables, N represents the number of endogeneous variables and p is the number of lags. In particular, in this model, \\(Y_t\\) contains 7 variables ordered as : (1) real GDP per-capita (\\(G_t\\)), (2) real government expenditure per-capita (\\(E_t\\)), (3) real government revenue per-capita (\\(R_t\\)), (4) real public debt per-capita (\\(D_t\\)), (5) inflation (\\(i_t\\)), (6) cash rate target (r_t), (7) real stock price (\\(S_t\\)).\n\\[\\begin{align}\nY_t=\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\\\ G_t\n\\\\ E_t\n\\\\ R_t\n\\\\ D_t\n\\\\ i_t\n\\\\ r_t\n\\\\ S_t\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\\(B_0\\) is \\(N\\times N\\) matrix capturing contemporaneous relationships between variables. \\(u_t\\) is \\(N\\times1\\) vector conditionally on \\(Y_{t-1}\\) orthogonal or independent structural shocks. Isolating these shocks allow us to identify dynamic effects of uncorrelated shocks on variables \\(y_t\\).\nThe reduced form representation is: \\[\\begin{align}\nY_t = \\mu_0 + \\sum_{i=1}^{p}A_{i}Y_{t-i}+\\epsilon_t\n\\end{align}\\] \\[\\begin{align}\n\\epsilon_t|Y_{t-1}\\sim iid(0_N,\\Sigma)\n\\end{align}\\]\nThe covariance matrix of \\(\\epsilon_t\\) can be written as: \\[\\begin{align}\n\\Sigma=B_0^{-1}{B_0^{-1}}^{'}\n\\end{align}\\]\nAs \\(\\Sigma\\) is a symmetric matrix with \\(N(N+1)/2\\) unique elements, \\(B_0\\) has \\(N^2\\) unknowns. \\(B_0\\) and \\(u_t\\) can’t be identified as the number of unknowns is more than equations. Restrictions exclusion (zero) restrictions, sign restrictions could be implemented, which would enable the assignment of economic meaning. Impulse response functions to orthogonal shocks computed from the SVAR model could be recognized as dynamic causal effects of exogenous shocks on economics variables. Forcast error variance decomposition provides information regarding the variability in forecast would also be conducted.\n\n\nPreliminary Results\nACF Plots as in Figure 3 show non-zero autocorrelations for at least 15 lags of variables except Inflation. PACF Plots as Figure 4 indicate significant and strong memory at the first lag of variables except Inflation, of, for which the first lag is also statistically significant but not strong.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: ACF Plots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Partial ACF Plots\n\n\n\n\nAugmented Dickey-Fuller Test can be performed to test for stationarity under the null hypothesis of unit-root non-stationary, the results are shown as Table 2, from which we do not reject the null and conclude that all variables are unit-root non-stationary.\n\nlibrary(tseries)\nadf <- as.data.frame(matrix(nrow=7,ncol=3,NA))\nrownames(adf) <- colnames(df)\ncolnames(adf) <- c(\"Dickey-Fuller\",\"Lag order\", \"p-value\")\n\nfor (i in 1: ncol(df)){\n  adf[i,\"Dickey-Fuller\"] <-  round(as.numeric(adf.test(df[,i])[1]),3)\n  adf[i,\"Lag order\"]<-  as.numeric(adf.test(df[,i])[2])\n  adf[i,\"p-value\"] <-  round(as.numeric(adf.test(df[,i])[4]),3)\n}\n\nknitr::kable(adf, index=TRUE)\n\n\n\nTable 2: ADF test results\n\n\n\nDickey-Fuller\nLag order\np-value\n\n\n\n\nGDP\n-2.701\n4\n0.288\n\n\nSpending\n-1.933\n4\n0.604\n\n\nRevenue\n-2.577\n4\n0.339\n\n\nDebt\n-2.470\n4\n0.383\n\n\nInflation\n-1.154\n4\n0.909\n\n\nInterest\n-2.177\n4\n0.503\n\n\nStock\n-2.573\n4\n0.340\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake the first difference and run the Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test again, it is sensible to conclude that variables except public debt are integrated of order 1 as in Table 3. Public debt is integrated with order 2, since its second-order difference is stationary (at 5% significance level) as Table 4.\n\n\n\n\nTable 3: First difference ADF test results\n\n\n\nDickey-Fuller\nLag order\np-value\n\n\n\n\nGDP\n-3.975\n4\n0.015\n\n\nSpending\n-4.178\n4\n0.010\n\n\nRevenue\n-5.593\n4\n0.010\n\n\nDebt\n-2.249\n4\n0.474\n\n\nInflation\n-6.179\n4\n0.010\n\n\nInterest\n-3.482\n4\n0.049\n\n\nStock\n-4.475\n4\n0.010\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4: Second difference ADF test results\n\n\n\nDickey-Fuller\nLag order\np-value\n\n\n\n\nDebt\n-5.525\n4\n0.01\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\nAfonso, A., R.
