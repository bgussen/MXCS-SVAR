This is a reserarch proposal, the research is about measuring fiscal policy effect using Structural VAR models in Australian Economy.\nKeywords. fiscal policy shock, SVAR, tax shocks, stock price\n\n\nIntroduction\nHow does tax cuts affect the economy? Will tax reductions boost stock market? This report aims to answer these questions in the background of Australian Economy. These questions are crucial to understanding of dynamic economics and the stimulus policy-making process.\n\n\nLiterature Review\nEstimated effects of tax shocks on output donâ€™t agree on each other in the previous literature.\n\n\nData\nThe variables that are of interest include GDP, total government expenditure, total government revenue, interest rate, inflation, public debt and stock prices. Justify.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethodology\nStructural vector autoregression (SVAR) models can be used to estimate the impact of taxation shocks in Australian economy. The benchmark model is defined as: \\[\\begin{align}\nB_0Y_t = b_0 + \\sum_{i=1}^{p}B_{i}Y_{t-i}+u_t\n\\end{align}\\] \\[\\begin{align}\nu_t|Y_{t-1}\\sim iid(0_N,I_N)\n\\end{align}\\]\n\\(Y_t\\) is \\(N\\times1\\) matrix of endogeneius variables, N represents the number of endogeneous variables and p is the number of lags, \\(B_0\\) is \\(N\\times N\\) matrix capturing contemporaneous relationships between variables, and \\(u_t\\) is \\(N\\times1\\) vector conditionally on \\(Y_{t-1}\\) orthogonal structural shocks.\nThe reduced form representation is: \\[\\begin{align}\nY_t = \\mu_0 + \\sum_{i=1}^{p}A_{i}Y_{t-i}+\\epsilon_t\n\\end{align}\\] \\[\\begin{align}\n\\epsilon_t|Y_{t-1}\\sim iid(0_N,\\Sigma)\n\\end{align}\\]\nThe covariance matrix of \\(\\epsilon_t\\) can be written as: \\[\\begin{align}\n\\Sigma=B_0^{-1}{B_0^{-1}}^{'}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nPreliminary Results\n\n\nReferences"
